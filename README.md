## **Peer To Peer Router**

The P2P Router application demonstrates STM32WBA acting at the same time as both: Bluetooth® LE central and peripheral, GATT server and client.

The P2P Router application scans to connect to P2P Server devices and accepts connections from the ST Web Bluetooth® app. It routes Bluetooth® LE messages received from both sides.

### **Requirements**

Example setup: one [NUCLEO-WBA5x](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-wba55cg.html "https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-wba55cg.html") board as a P2P Router, two NUCLEO-WBA5x boards and one [P-NUCLEO-WB55](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-wb55.html "https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-wb55.html") as P2P Servers.  

You need a P2P Router running on an STM32WBA5x and at least one other STM32WBAxx / STM32WB Nucleo board running a P2P Server application.

### **Follow these steps to learn how to use the P2P Router application**

**Step 1.** Power the P2P Router board with the P2P Router application flashed and power the other boards with the P2P Server applications.  
**Step 2.** Activate Bluetooth® on your machine.   
**Step 3.** Open [this](https://applible.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App/ "https://applible.github.io/Web_Bluetooth_App") web page in your browser.  
**Step 4.** Click the Connect button, select `P2PR_WBAxx` in the device list, and click Pair.  
*You are now connected.*  
**Step 5.** Click P2P Router to show the interface and click the Start button.
*You can now interact with the connected device.*  
**Step 6.** Power up to seven P2P Server devices near the P2P Router device.
**Step 7.** On each click of B1, the P2P Router will scan and then connect to a surrounding P2P Server device.
**Step 8.** On the Web Bluetooth® interface you can see devices appearing.
![Step 8](/public/illustrations/routerDevAppear.PNG "Step 8")  
**Step 9.** On a P2P Server device, a click on B1 sends a notification to the P2P Router. 
This notification message is forwarded to the smartphone and displayed on the interface.
![Step 9](/public/illustrations/notifON.PNG "Step 9")
**Step 10.** On the Web Bluetooth® interface, click the Light button to write a message to the corresponding P2P Server device. This write message is first sent to the P2P Router and then routed to its destination.
![Step 10](/public/illustrations/lightOn.PNG "Step 10")
